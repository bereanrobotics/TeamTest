# TeamTest

This module plugs into the ftc_app master framework as a specific configuration option when building.  This module contains all of the code the team uses for test robots.

This module depends upon DoppleBot.  Please ensure the DoppleBot framework is installed in your project.
DoppleBot is typically installed into the FtcRobotController module within src/java so that it can be available to other modules.
